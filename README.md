# Introduction
Due to improvements in manufacturing and the development of more effective photovoltaic cells, solar energy has seen a rapid increase in popularity. From the data available from OurWorldInData
We can see that the amount of solar energy being produced has increased exponentially.

Solar energy is likely to continue playing an important role in our transition towards cleaner energy production in the coming years. Since solar power generation is inherently intermittent
it is vital that we have systems that can store excess energy for later use and that we are able to reliably estimate the energy that will be produced in the future. When energy production
from intermittent sources falls sharply and unexpectedly the sudden spike in demand for energy from other sources can lead to steep price increases.

# The Data
Data on the intensity of sunlight in a given region can be found at the National Renewable Energy Labs (NREL) National Solar Radiation Database (NRSDB), https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/ . The 
data cover all of the US and at a resoltion of 1km x 1km with snapshots being taken every 30 minutes. In order to access the data you'll need to set up an API key and follow the instructions
provided at https://github.com/NREL/hsds-examples/blob/master/notebooks/03_NSRDB_introduction.ipynb .
